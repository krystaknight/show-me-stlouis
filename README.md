# Show Me St. Louis!

Sharing my favorite 5 places to see in St. Louis.

All place info is from the FourSquare api. https://developer.foursquare.com/

## Filters
Using the filter you can see what places are cool and aren't cool, but be aware, the cool places will change each time you visit!

### Goals
1. Share my 5 favorite places to visit in my town using the Google Maps API.
2. Mark each of those places with a Google marker.
3. Get additional information for each place from a third party API.
4. Using KnockoutJs, list these five places in a side bar.
5. If a marker is clicked an info-window should appear and the coordinating list item should be indicated.
6. If a list item is clicked the coordinating marking should be indicated.
7. Gracefully handle any API errors.
